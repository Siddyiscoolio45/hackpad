After a lot of work, I present my macropad:

I wanted to create this macropad to speed up the work I do at my desk, and I mapped the macropad keys to my most used computer commands, like copy/paste, and undo/redo. 
I opted for a more unique design with more buttons and a rotary encoder for volume control. I also tried to add LEDs as a backlight so I can use the Macropad in the dark.

BOM:

* 6x CherryMX Switches
* 2x SK6812 MINI LEDs
* 1x Through-hole Xiao RP2040
* 6x Blank Keycaps
* 4x M3x16 Bolts
* 4x M3 heatset inserts
